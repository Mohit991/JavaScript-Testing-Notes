Let's say we have a function to calculate interest.

To test this function manually, we will have to do the following steps:

We can make use of automated testing here:

We can write some code to call this function directly with various inputs. 
And check if it returns the correct results.

We execute this code with a program called a test runner.  This will display the test results in the console or the terminal window.

If the test passes, we see a green tick otherwise we see a red cross.  
We can run any number of tests in just a few seconds.

We have two types of code here:
1. Prod code which is the actual code of the application.
2. Test code, which is written to test the prod code.
